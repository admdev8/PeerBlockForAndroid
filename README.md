# PeerBlockForAndroid
An experimental project for Android, PeerBlock

Previously PeerBlockForAndroid was closed source, which was a bad view for a security program like this
As it's open-source currently, you are allowed to modify the source code in any way and form you so desire to do so
I will probably not develop this project anymore as I got busy myself with different projects
The last working XPosed Framework that worked on this was Lollipop (correct me if I'm wrong it's been 2 years)

All the pull requests that will be made are really appreciated and I will merge them into this project
If there are any brave men who are willing to take over maintaining this project, feel free to do so

This will be the main Repo for PeerBlockForAndroid, expect updates from others through pull requests
